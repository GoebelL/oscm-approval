## Email Templates
You can customize the appearence and content of the approval request emails which are issued to the approver.

Therefore
1. Download the [email template](https://github.com/servicecatalog/oscm-app/blob/master/oscm-app-approval/src/main/resources/approvalEmail.html) from the GitHub repo.
2. Edit the HTML content as desired. Use inline CSS as desired.
4. Following placeholder variables are available: ```$(mail.body), $(service.name), $(service.technicalId), $(service.price.text), $(service.price.type), $(service.price.freePeriod), $(service.price.oneTimeFee), $(service.price.currency), $(user.orgId), $(user.email), $(user.firstname), $(user.lastname), $(user.key)```.<br>The notification service will fill in the placeholders with the respective data retrieved from the subscription trigger. 
5. Open `https://<FQDN>/oscm-app-approval`
6. Login as supplier
7. Use the `import` button in the section `Service templates` in order to upload your HTML email template
8. All subsequent approval requests will use this email template. Just test it as described above  
 

## Trouble Shooting Hints
1. Use docker logs -f oscm-app
2. Connect approval DB with PGAdmin and check the created data, esp. User Ids.
